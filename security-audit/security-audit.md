# Full Security Audit

You are performing a comprehensive security audit of the codebase in the current working directory. Treat this with the rigor of a professional penetration test. Your job is to find real, exploitable vulnerabilities — not style issues.

## Execution Strategy

You MUST use subagents extensively to avoid context exhaustion. The audit has 5 phases:

1. **Planning** — Discover project structure, identify attack surface
2. **Deep Investigation** — Parallel subagents per security domain
3. **Initial Report & Triage** — Synthesize findings, rank by severity
4. **Reproduction & Fix** — Parallel subagents to confirm each finding and write tests/fixes
5. **Final Report** — Detailed, actionable output

---

## PHASE 1: PLANNING & DISCOVERY

Before spawning any investigation agents, you must understand what you're auditing. Do this yourself (do NOT delegate):

### Step 1: Discover the project
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` if they exist
- Read the primary manifest file(s): `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, etc.
- Run `ls` on the root and `src/` (or equivalent) to understand the directory layout
- Identify the **language(s)**, **framework(s)**, **build system**, and **project type** (library, server, CLI tool, web app, etc.)

### Step 2: Identify security-relevant areas
Based on what you discover, identify:
- **Trust boundaries**: Where does external input enter? (network, files, CLI args, environment variables, IPC, database, user input in web forms, API requests)
- **Attack surface**: Which modules handle untrusted data? (parsers, protocol handlers, auth, crypto, serialization/deserialization, file I/O, SQL/query builders, template rendering, HTTP handlers)
- **Threat actors**: Who could attack this? (remote unauthenticated, authenticated user, malicious peer/server, man-in-the-middle, local attacker, supply chain)
- **Security-critical files**: List the specific files/modules that handle auth, crypto, parsing, network I/O, input validation, and access control

### Step 3: Write your threat model
Write down:
1. Project summary (what it is, what language, what it does)
2. The trust boundaries you identified
3. The attack surface map (module → what untrusted input it handles)
4. The threat actors relevant to this project
5. Which of the 8 investigation domains below are applicable (skip domains that don't apply — e.g., skip "TLS & Crypto" for a pure CLI tool that doesn't do networking)

Then proceed to Phase 2, adapting the agent prompts based on your discovery.

---

## PHASE 2: DEEP INVESTIGATION

Launch the applicable subagents **in parallel**. For each agent, you MUST customize the prompt based on what you learned in Phase 1 — replace the `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with actual file paths, module names, and project-specific details. Do not send generic prompts.

Each agent must be thorough — read every relevant file, trace data flows end-to-end, check edge cases. Each agent must return structured findings.

**CRITICAL**: When writing each agent's prompt, prepend this context block (filled in from Phase 1):
```
PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Language: [language]
- Type: [library/server/CLI/web app/etc.]
- Key files for this domain: [list the specific files this agent should read]
- Trust boundaries relevant to this domain: [which boundaries apply]
```

### Agent 1: Network Protocol & Parser Security
*Skip if the project does no network I/O or protocol parsing.*

```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit all network protocol parsing and serialization code for memory safety and correctness.

Focus areas:
- Buffer/stream handling — can a malicious peer send crafted input that causes:
  - Buffer overflows, unbounded allocation (OOM / DoS)
  - Integer overflow in length/size fields
  - Incomplete frame/message handling that corrupts parser state
- Message/frame parsing — for each message type the code can receive:
  - Malformed messages: missing delimiters, truncated data, extra fields
  - Oversized payloads: are size limits enforced?
  - Nested structure parsing: can malformed inner data cause panics?
  - Encoding issues: UTF-8 validation, charset handling
- Serialization/output:
  - Can user-controlled input inject protocol commands or escape framing? (e.g., CRLF injection in text protocols, length confusion in binary protocols)
  - Are outputs correctly delimited/length-prefixed?
- Language-specific:
  - [Rust] Look for unwrap(), expect(), panic!(), unreachable!() in parsing paths; unchecked `as usize` casts; unchecked arithmetic on network-derived sizes
  - [Go] Look for unchecked slice indexing, integer truncation, ignored error returns in I/O paths
  - [C/C++] Look for buffer overflows, format strings, integer overflows, use-after-free
  - [Python/JS/Java] Look for regex DoS, deserialization of untrusted data, type confusion

Discover which files handle protocol/network I/O by searching for: socket, connect, read, write, parse, decode, encode, serialize, deserialize, frame, packet, buffer, stream, recv, send

For each finding, provide:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info
- Location: file:line_number
- Description: What the issue is
- Exploitation: How an attacker could trigger it
- Impact: What happens (DoS, info leak, code execution, etc.)
```

### Agent 2: TLS, Crypto & Secrets Management

```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit TLS configuration, cryptographic operations, and secrets handling.

```

### Agent 3: Authentication & Authorization
*Skip if the project has no auth mechanisms.*

```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Focus areas:
- Authentication flows:
  - What auth methods are supported? (password, token, API key, OAuth, mTLS, SSO, etc.)
  - Are credentials transmitted securely?
  - Are credentials stored securely? (hashing, encryption at rest)
  - Session management: secure token generation? Expiry? Invalidation?
  - Multi-factor: is it bypassable?
  - Password reset: secure flow? Account enumeration?

- Authorization:
  - Are access controls enforced server-side (not just client-side)?
  - Can authorization checks be bypassed? (IDOR, privilege escalation, path traversal)

  - Unbounded collections: buffers, queues, caches, maps that grow without limit from external input
  - Large allocation from attacker-controlled size fields
  - Memory leaks: resources not freed on error paths
- CPU exhaustion:
  - Algorithmic complexity: O(n²) or worse on attacker-controlled input (hash collision, regex backtracking, sorting)
  - Regex: catastrophic backtracking on crafted input (search for all regex patterns)
  - Recursive parsing: stack overflow on deeply nested input (JSON, XML, ASN.1, etc.)
  - Retry storms: can a peer force tight retry loops without backoff?
- Resource exhaustion:
  - File descriptors: unbounded connections/file handles?
  - Disk: unbounded log/temp file growth from attacker input?
  - Threads/goroutines/tasks: can an attacker spawn unbounded concurrent work?
- Deadlocks and livelocks:
  - Lock ordering issues?

  - Graceful shutdown: can it hang indefinitely?
- Slowloris-style:
  - Timeout enforcement: are there read/write/connection timeouts on all I/O?
  - Partial input: does the system handle slow/incomplete data?
  - Keep-alive abuse?

Discover relevant files by searching for: buffer, queue, cache, channel, timeout, retry, backoff, limit, capacity, pool, spawn, thread, goroutine, tokio::spawn, async, worker

For each finding, provide structured output with Severity, Location, Description, Exploitation, Impact.
```

### Agent 5: Input Validation & Injection
```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit all input validation and injection attack surfaces.

Focus areas:
- Injection attacks (check ALL that apply to this codebase):
  - SQL injection: parameterized queries or string concatenation?
  - Command injection: shell execution with user input? (search for exec, system, popen, subprocess, child_process)
  - Path traversal: file operations with user-controlled paths? (../ sequences, symlink following, null bytes)
  - LDAP/NoSQL/XML/XPath injection
  - Template injection (SSTI)
  - Header injection: CRLF injection in HTTP headers, email headers, protocol frames
  - Log injection: can user input forge log entries?
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) — if web-facing:
  - Reflected, stored, DOM-based XSS
  - Content-Type sniffing
  - CSP headers
- Deserialization:
  - Is untrusted data deserialized? (pickle, yaml.load, Java ObjectInputStream, JSON with type hints, protobuf, msgpack)
  - Can deserialization trigger code execution or type confusion?
- Input validation consistency:
  - Is validation applied at the boundary or scattered throughout?
  - Are there code paths that skip validation?
  - Is validation consistent between different entry points for the same data?
  - Maximum size/length enforcement on all inputs?

For each finding, provide structured output with Severity, Location, Description, Exploitation, Impact.
```

### Agent 6: Dependency & Supply Chain Security
```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and supply chain risks.

Focus areas:
- Known vulnerabilities:
  - [Rust] Run: cargo audit (if available), review Cargo.lock
  - [Node] Run: npm audit or check package-lock.json
  - [Python] Run: pip audit or check requirements.txt / poetry.lock
  - [Go] Run: govulncheck or check go.sum
  - [Java] Check dependency versions against NVD
  - If audit tools aren't available, manually review key dependencies for known CVEs
- Dependency hygiene:
  - Are versions pinned? (lockfile present and committed?)
  - Are there dependencies with concerning permissions? (build scripts, native code, post-install hooks)
  - Are optional/dev dependencies properly separated?
  - Are there vendored dependencies? Are they up to date?
- Unsafe code review:
  - [Rust] Search for all `unsafe` blocks — is each one necessary? Sound? Documented?
  - [C/C++] Search for dangerous functions: strcpy, sprintf, gets, system, etc.
  - [Go] Search for `unsafe.Pointer`
- Build security:
  - Are there build scripts (build.rs, Makefile, setup.py)? What do they execute?
  - Could a compromised dependency execute arbitrary code at build time?
  - CI configuration: are secrets properly scoped? Are there dangerous permissions?

  - Check license compatibility
  - Any copyleft licenses in a permissive-licensed project?

For each finding, provide structured output with Severity, Location, Description, Exploitation, Impact.
```

### Agent 7: Recent Git History Security Review
```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit recent git history for security-relevant changes and leaked secrets.

Focus areas:
- Review recent commits: git log --oneline -50
  - For security-relevant commits (auth, crypto, parsing, validation, deps), run git show to review the full diff
  - Look for:
    - Security fixes that may be incomplete (partially fixed vuln)
    - Changes that weaken validation, remove checks, or relax error handling
    - New unsafe/dangerous code patterns introduced
    - Dependency updates that might introduce vulnerabilities
    - Changes to CI/CD that weaken security checks (removed linting, test skipping)
    - Reverted security changes
- Secrets in history:
  - Search recent diffs for: password, secret, key, token, credential, API_KEY, AWS_, PRIVATE, BEGIN RSA, BEGIN EC, BEGIN OPENSSH
  - Check .gitignore: does it exclude .env, *.pem, *.key, credentials.*, config/secrets.*?
  - Look for test credentials/keys that might be real (especially in config files, docker-compose, CI configs)
- Open PRs (if gh CLI available):
  - Run `gh pr list` to find open PRs
  - Review any that touch security-sensitive files

Use git commands to explore history. Use `gh` CLI for PR review if available.

For each finding, provide structured output with Severity, Location, Description, Exploitation, Impact.
```

### Agent 8: Concurrency & Race Condition Analysis
*Skip if the project is single-threaded with no async/concurrent operations.*

```
[PROJECT CONTEXT block]

Audit for concurrency bugs that could have security implications.

Focus areas:
- Shared mutable state:
  - What state is shared across threads/tasks/goroutines?
  - Are there TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) bugs? (especially in file operations, permission checks, auth)
  - [Rust] Are Arc<Mutex<T>> patterns used correctly? Any lock poisoning issues?
  - [Go] Are there race conditions on shared maps, slices, or structs? (suggest running with -race flag)
  - [Python] GIL does not protect against logical races — check shared state in async code
  - [Java/C++] Check for data races on shared fields without proper synchronization
- Channel/queue safety:
  - Can messages be lost, duplicated, or reordered in a security-relevant way?
  - What happens when channels/queues are full? (deadlock? drop? block?)
  - What happens on channel close during active operations?
- State machine integrity:
  - Connection/session state machines: can concurrent events cause invalid state transitions?
  - Can auth state become inconsistent? (e.g., authenticated flag set before auth completes)
  - Reconnection/retry: can user operations race with reconnection logic?
- Callback/handler safety:
  - Can user callbacks deadlock the main loop?
  - Are callbacks invoked with locks held?
  - Can callbacks cause re-entrant calls?
- Shutdown races:
  - Can operations proceed after shutdown/drain/close starts?
  - Is cleanup idempotent?
  - Can drop/finalizer/destructor race with active operations?

Discover relevant files by searching for: mutex, lock, rwlock, atomic, sync, channel, mpsc, spawn, thread, goroutine, async, await, concurrent, parallel, Arc, Rc, RefCell, volatile, synchronized

For each finding, provide structured output with Severity, Location, Description, Exploitation, Impact.
```

## PHASE 3: INITIAL REPORT & TRIAGE

After ALL Phase 2 agents complete, synthesize their findings:

1. **Deduplicate** — Multiple agents may find the same issue from different angles. Merge them.
2. **Classify** each unique finding:
   - **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational
   - **Confidence**: Confirmed / Likely / Possible / Theoretical
   - **Category**: Memory Safety / Injection / DoS / Crypto / Auth / Race Condition / Supply Chain / Info Leak
3. **Rank** by severity × confidence (Critical+Confirmed first, Informational+Theoretical last)
4. **Filter**: Drop "Informational" findings with "Theoretical" confidence — they add noise, not signal
5. Assign each finding an ID: `SEC-001`, `SEC-002`, etc.
6. Write a summary table of all findings ranked by priority

Present the initial findings table to build context for Phase 4.

---

## PHASE 4: REPRODUCTION & FIX PROPOSALS

For each finding rated **Medium or above** AND **Possible confidence or above**, launch a subagent. Batch them in groups of 4-6 if there are many.

Each agent gets this prompt (fill in the `[PLACEHOLDERS]` per finding):

```
You are verifying a specific security finding and proposing a fix for a [LANGUAGE] project.

## Finding
- ID: [SEC-NNN]
- Title: [TITLE]
- Severity: [SEVERITY]
- Location: [FILE:LINE]
- Description: [DESCRIPTION]
- Exploitation scenario: [HOW TO EXPLOIT]

## Your Tasks

### 1. Verify the Finding
- Read the code at the specified location and surrounding context
- Trace the data flow end-to-end to confirm the vulnerability
- Check if existing defenses (validation, bounds checks, error handling) already mitigate this
- If the issue involves parsing or input handling, construct a specific malicious input that would trigger it
- Rate your confidence: Confirmed / Likely / Possible / False Positive
- If False Positive, explain exactly what defense prevents exploitation

### 2. Write a Proof-of-Concept Test
Write a test in the project's language and test framework that demonstrates the vulnerability:
- Place it in the project's existing test structure (find where tests live first)
- Name it clearly: `test_security_[id]_[short_description]`
- Include a comment explaining the security implication
- The test should PASS when the vulnerability EXISTS (so it fails once fixed)
- For DoS issues: demonstrate resource growth with bounded malicious input
- For injection: demonstrate that malicious input passes through unescaped/unvalidated
- If the issue cannot be tested directly (design concern, needs custom malicious peer), explain why and write a test that validates the FIX instead

### 3. Propose a Fix
- Describe the minimal code change needed
- Write the actual code change (show before/after or a diff)
- Explain why this fix is correct and complete
- Note any backwards compatibility impact
- Note any performance impact
- If the fix requires a breaking API change, suggest a migration path

### 4. Output
Return a structured report:
- **Verified**: Yes / No / Partial — with explanation
- **Confidence Adjustment**: Same / Upgraded / Downgraded to [level] — why?
- **PoC Test**: [the test code] or [explanation why not testable]
- **Proposed Fix**: [the code change]
- **Fix Explanation**: [correctness argument, compat notes, perf notes]
- **Breaking Change**: Yes/No — [details]
```

---

[Repeat for each finding, ordered by severity]

## Recommendations
[Prioritized action items, including any architectural concerns that aren't individual findings]

## Scope Limitations
[What was NOT checked, known blind spots, areas that need manual review]
[e.g., "Binary dependencies were not decompiled", "Integration test coverage of auth flows was not assessed", "Fuzz testing was not performed"]
```

---

## Important Guidelines

- **Be thorough but precise**: False positives waste maintainer time. If you're unsure, mark confidence as "Possible" — never inflate to "Confirmed" without evidence.
- **Language-aware analysis**: Understand what your language's type system / runtime prevents. Rust's borrow checker prevents use-after-free — don't report those. Go's GC prevents double-free — don't report those. Focus on what CAN go wrong in each language.
- **Real-world exploitability**: Prioritize findings that a real attacker could exploit over theoretical concerns about code style or "best practices". A confirmed Medium beats a theoretical Critical.
- **Don't skip phases**: Even if Phase 2 finds nothing critical, still run Phase 4 verification on Medium findings — initial analysis might have missed mitigating context.
- **Adapt to the project**: Not every domain applies to every project. A pure computation library won't have auth issues. A CLI tool won't have XSS. Skip irrelevant agents but document what you skipped and why in the final report.
- **Check cross-language equivalents**: If NATS MCP tools are available, use `find_equivalent` to check how other implementations of the same protocol handle the same security concern — this reveals whether an issue is protocol-level or implementation-specific.
